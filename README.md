-	Raw Listings Data: CSV file containing all available listings data on Airbnb for December 2021 within Chicago
-	Geo Export Data: Contains latitude and longitude coordinates for all listings
-	Neighborhood Categorized: Cleaned neighborhood data which segments each listing into a neighborhood in Chicago
-	Training Dataset: Cleaned up training dataset after all feature engineering 
-	Testing Dataset: Cleaned up testing dataset after all feature engineering
2.	Predictions: CSV containing our predicted prices 
3.	Notebook: 
-	Project: The central code for this project containing: Exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, feature selection, model engineering and final results.
4.	Slides: A PowerPoint summarizing our findings and intuitively explaining the business value of this project.

#### Detailed Project Description: 

We use the listings data for Airbnb for December 2021 within Chicago to build a model which predicts the price of a new listing. The data contains the price of each listing and an additional 73 features describing the listing itself. We perform popular EDA techniques to inform our feature cleaning and feature engineering. This project is a culmination of our learnings from the Data Mining class. Following are some of the algorithms utilized for machine learning and data mining: 

1.	K-nearest neighbor 
2.	Linear Regression 
3.	Decision Tree 
4.	Gradient Boosting 
5.	Random Forest 
6.	XG Boost 
7.	Multi-Layer Perceptron 
8.	Ensemble Learning
